Processing by StudentGroupsController#index as HTML
DEPRECATION WARNING: Using #scope without passing a callable object is deprecated. For example `scope :red, where(color: 'red')` should be changed to `scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }`. There are numerous gotchas in the former usage and it makes the implementation more complicated and buggy. (If you prefer, you can just define a class method named `self.red`.).

DEPRECATION WARNING: Using #scope without passing a callable object is deprecated. For example `scope :red, where(color: 'red')` should be changed to `scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }`. There are numerous gotchas in the former usage and it makes the implementation more complicated and buggy. (If you prefer, you can just define a class method named `self.red`.).

DEPRECATION WARNING: Using #scope without passing a callable object is deprecated. For example `scope :red, where(color: 'red')` should be changed to `scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }`. There are numerous gotchas in the former usage and it makes the implementation more complicated and buggy. (If you prefer, you can just define a class method named `self.red`.).

DEPRECATION WARNING: Using #scope without passing a callable object is deprecated. For example `scope :red, where(color: 'red')` should be changed to `scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }`. There are numerous gotchas in the former usage and it makes the implementation more complicated and buggy. (If you prefer, you can just define a class method named `self.red`.).

DEPRECATION WARNING: Using #scope without passing a callable object is deprecated. For example `scope :red, where(color: 'red')` should be changed to `scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }`. There are numerous gotchas in the former usage and it makes the implementation more complicated and buggy. (If you prefer, you can just define a class method named `self.red`.).

Processing by StudentGroupsController#index as HTML
DEPRECATION WARNING: Using #scope without passing a callable object is deprecated. For example `scope :red, where(color: 'red')` should be changed to `scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }`. There are numerous gotchas in the former usage and it makes the implementation more complicated and buggy. (If you prefer, you can just define a class method named `self.red`.).
